# AI Product Recommender

A simple web app that lets users describe what they want and returns curated product recommendations using an AI model. Built with Vercel and an AI API.

## 🚀 Features

- 🛍️ Ask for product suggestions using natural language
- 🤖 AI-powered recommendations with pros & cons
- ⚡ Fast and responsive UI
- 🔥 Deployed on Vercel

## 💡 How It Works

1. User enters a product query in the app.
2. Frontend sends the query to an API endpoint.
3. Backend calls an AI model (like OpenAI/Gemini) to generate product suggestions.
4. Suggestions are displayed back to the user.

## 🧠 Example Query

> *“Recommend 3 budget smartphones under ₹15,000 with pros & cons.”*
